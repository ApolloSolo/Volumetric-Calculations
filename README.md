# Volumetric-Calculations
Frac Tank Volume Calculation -
This is my initial attempt at creating a simple interface in which to enter measurement data. On site, there are multiple tanks. These tanks fill with a gas and water mixture, which settles out. We want to track our influent volume, and to do so, we use interface probes to measure the distance between a fix point and depth to product/gas (DTP) and the distance between the same fixed point and the water interfaces with the gas known as depth to water (DTW). I then convert the top down distance to bottom up distances to determine inches of gas and water sitting in the tank. I then utilize a key value pares, which represents volume (gallons) at different levels (inches) inside the tank. Using JavaScript, the inputs are then used to calculated volume data. For frac tank 1A, I used my limited knowledge and practice with experience to convert the input values to gallon outputs. It is far from optimal. For frac tank 1B, I implemented a more OOP approach (still far from optimal). My goal for this project is to create a program which implements JavaScript best practices (not sure what they are yet) and utilize a backend and database to store output volume data. I would then like to use that data to track daily trends for various datasets i.e. daily throughput, daily totalized volumes, and tank specific trends.
